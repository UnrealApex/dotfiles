### About
This is my `init.vim`. Like all other configuration files, these contain the configurations that make Neovim feel at home for me.
Instead of copying and pasting all my configurations, I encourage you to modify off my own as certain configurations I like are not necessarily what you like as well.
### Plugins
I have several plugins to enhance my experience using Neovim. As a side note, this config and its plugins are all compatible with Vim, just make sure to rename `init.vim` to `.vimrc`
My plugins are managed using [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug).
If you use my init.vim and [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug) is not present on your system, it will automatically install it so be aware of that.
